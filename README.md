### Introduction
This project is created for writing a C program which is for organizing three kinds of publications in a bookstore.

### Description
In a bookstore, there are three kinds of publications on sale: books, periodicals and encyclopedia.

There is a text file named _"inputbookdb.txt"_ storing all the publications. The file consists of a number of lines where each line is a publication, the format of which depends on the publication. Formats are as the following:

* Book B # Name # Author # Price # IsInStock

3) _**Size:**_ Shows the number of entries within the list.<br>
4) _**Display:**_ Display the content of the ith (smallest) node.<br>
5) _**Display All:**_ Displays all content.<br>
6) _**Saving:**_ Saves the content of the list into the file named _"outputbookdb.txt"_. Its format is the same as _"inputbookdb.txt"_.<br>
7) _**Quitting:**_ Quit the program.<br>
